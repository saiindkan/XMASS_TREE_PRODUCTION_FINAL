-- SECURE PRODUCTION FIX: Maintain RLS security while fixing permissions
-- This keeps your data secure while allowing OTP verification to work

-- 1. Check current RLS status
SELECT '=== CURRENT RLS STATUS ===' as info;
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity,
    tableowner
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'password_resets';

-- 2. First, let's check what user/role is actually connecting
SELECT '=== CONNECTION ANALYSIS ===' as info;
SELECT 
    current_user,
    current_setting('role'),
    session_user,
    current_setting('application_name') as app_name;

-- 3. Check if the service role key is properly configured
SELECT '=== SERVICE ROLE CHECK ===' as info;
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN current_setting('role') = 'service_role' THEN '✅ Connected as service_role'
        WHEN current_setting('role') = 'postgres' THEN '✅ Connected as postgres (superuser)'
        WHEN current_setting('role') = 'authenticated' THEN '⚠️ Connected as authenticated user'
        ELSE '❌ Connected as: ' || current_setting('role')
    END as connection_status;

-- 4. Drop existing policies and create secure ones
SELECT '=== CREATING SECURE POLICIES ===' as info;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create password reset requests" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their password reset requests" ON password_resets;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their password reset requests" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for password resets" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OTP creation for password reset" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OTP verification" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OTP update for reset token" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow OTP cleanup" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all password reset operations" ON password_resets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations" ON password_resets;

-- Create secure policies that allow service role access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON password_resets
FOR ALL USING (
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR 
    current_setting('role') = 'postgres'
);

-- Allow authenticated users to create their own reset requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own reset requests" ON password_resets
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    email = auth.jwt() ->> 'email'
);

-- Allow users to view their own reset requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reset requests" ON password_resets
FOR SELECT USING (
    email = auth.jwt() ->> 'email' OR
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR
    current_setting('role') = 'postgres'
);

-- Allow service role to update any reset request (for OTP verification)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can update reset requests" ON password_resets
FOR UPDATE USING (
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR
    current_setting('role') = 'postgres'
);

-- Allow service role to delete expired requests
CREATE POLICY "Service role can delete expired requests" ON password_resets
FOR DELETE USING (
    current_setting('role') = 'service_role' OR
    current_setting('role') = 'postgres'
);

-- 5. Verify policies were created
SELECT '=== VERIFYING POLICIES ===' as info;
SELECT 
    policyname,
    permissive,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'password_resets'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- 6. Test if UPDATE now works with service role
SELECT '=== TESTING SECURE UPDATE ===' as info;

-- 7. Show final secure status
SELECT '=== FINAL SECURE STATUS ===' as info;
