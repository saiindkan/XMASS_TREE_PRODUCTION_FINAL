-- Simple working RLS fix - Clean version (handles existing policies)
-- Keeps RLS enabled while fixing the permission issue

-- 1. Check what's currently blocking us

    permissive,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'password_resets'

-- 3. Drop ALL existing policies to start completely fresh
SELECT '=== DROPPING ALL EXISTING POLICIES ===' as info;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create password reset requests" ON password_resets;
