-- Check Current Database Tables
-- Run this to see what tables exist before cleanup

-- 1. List all tables in public schema
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_type
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 2. Check table sizes and row counts
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins as rows_inserted,
    n_tup_upd as rows_updated,
    n_tup_del as rows_deleted
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 3. Check foreign key relationships
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
    AND tc.table_schema = 'public';

-- 4. Check RLS policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
