# 🔧 Fix Summary: Order Items Not Updating

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The order items are not being stored correctly in the database. Here's what I found:

### ✅ **What's Working**
- QR payments are being created successfully
- Items are being passed correctly in the `customer_info`
- The orders API is set up to handle items correctly

### ❌ **What's Not Working**
- Orders are not being created when QR payments are processed
- The QR payment status is being set to 'completed' immediately instead of 'pending'
- This prevents the order creation process from running

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The issue is that **Stripe keys are not configured** in the environment variables. This causes:

1. **Stripe Payment Intent creation fails** (but doesn't throw an error)
2. **QR payment status gets set to 'completed'** instead of 'pending'
3. **Order creation process never runs** because it requires 'pending' status

## 🚀 **Solution**

### Step 1: Add Stripe Keys to `.env.local`

```bash
# Add these to your .env.local file
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
STRIPE_QR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_qr_webhook_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Get Stripe Test Keys

1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Create account or sign in
3. Go to Dashboard → Developers → API keys
4. Copy your **Test** keys (not Live keys)

### Step 3: Test the System

After adding the keys:

```bash
# Restart the development server
npm run dev

# Test the system
node test-order-creation.js
```

## 🧪 **Expected Results After Fix**

Once Stripe keys are added:

1. **QR payments will be created with 'pending' status**
2. **Payment processing will work correctly**
3. **Orders will be created with items**
4. **Order items will be displayed correctly**

## 📊 **Current Status**

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **QR Payment Creation** | ✅ Working | Items passed correctly |
| **QR Payment Processing** | ❌ Failing | Status set to 'completed' immediately |
| **Order Creation** | ❌ Not Running | Requires 'pending' status |
| **Items Storage** | ❌ Not Working | Orders not created |
| **Orders API** | ✅ Ready | Will work once orders are created |

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Add Stripe keys** to `.env.local`
2. **Restart development server**
3. **Test the system** with `node test-order-creation.js`
4. **Verify orders are created** with items
