# 🎉 Order Items Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The order items are now working correctly! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue was that QR payments were being created with status `"completed"` instead of `"pending"`, which prevented the order creation process from running.

### 🚀 **Solution Applied**

1. **Modified QR Payment Handler** (`src/lib/qr-payment-handler.ts`):
   - Allow order creation for both `"pending"` and `"completed"` statuses
   - Added debug logging for completed payments

2. **Modified QR Payment Processing API** (`src/app/api/stripe-qr-payment/process/route.ts`):
   - Allow test payments to process even if status is `"completed"`
   - Added order creation for test payments

3. **Updated Checkout Page** (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`):
   - Include cart items in customer info when creating QR payments

## 🧪 **Test Results**
